This is the Android client for [Elenoon-Drive][2].

The app performs file synchronization with an Elenoon-Drive[3] server in Islamic Republic of Iran.
Other Elenoon-Drive features may be added in the future, but they are not a priority right now.

Make sure you read [SETUP.md][1] when you start working on this project.
